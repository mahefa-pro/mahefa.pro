<h1> Mahefa Abel </h1>

I’m a software engineer in Africa.

[Projects](/projects)

_“Everything” I work on._

I produce projects and documentation at wildly different rates, so this is by no means comprehensive.

[Incantations](/spellbook)

_n. spells or verbal charms spoken as part of a ritual_

Snippets of code, configuration, or script–typically hard-earned–that might save you from Googling.
